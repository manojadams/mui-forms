-   It can either be a single value or an array of values.
-   The current field will be displayed only if the reference field has the same value as the value specified here.
-   In case `value` is array, it will try to check if it contains any value matching the reference field value.

### Special values

These values are special values which has specific purpose

| Name       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $condition | It will parse the condition from the `condition` property and will display the field only if it result is true.                                                                                |

| $valueFn   | It will execute a function and display the field if result is true. The function name is taken from the property `valueFn` and it must be passed as an input property `fns` from the component |

### Condition

Condition allows to build on advanced criteria's that can satisfy a dependency. The value of this property should be array. It can contain multiple conditions

A condition is divided into four parts:

-   Operand
-   Operator
-   Value
-   Next condition

Model details:

```typescript
type Condition = [Operand, Operator, Operand | Value, NextCondition?];

interface Operand {
    ref: string;
    section?: string;
}

type Operator = "===" | ">=" | "<=";

type Value = string | number | boolean | Date | undefined | null;

type NextCondition = "&&" | "||";
```

### Example

```typescript
condition: [[{ ref: "<field_name>", section: "<section_name>" }, "===", true]];
```

## Exists dependency example

import SalariedForm from "../../components/dependencies/SalariedForm";
import schema from "../../components/dependencies/SalariedForm/schema.json";
import SchemaViewer from "../../components/SchemaViewer";

<SalariedForm />

## Schema

<SchemaViewer value={schema} />
