## Custom fields

There are two ways to add custom components:
- controls
- components

### Controls
Controls are custom components whose input properties are customizable.

```typescript
    import Pie from "<location>";
    <MuiForms
        ...
        controls={{
            "piechart": <Pie {...props} />
        }}
        ... 
    />
```

### Components
Components are also custom components that have fixed input properties.

```typescript
    import Pie from "<location>";
    <MuiForms
        ...
        components={{
            "piechart": Pie
        }}
        ... 
    />
```

#### Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| form     | A map of all form fields and their values | 
| field    | Properties of the current field |
